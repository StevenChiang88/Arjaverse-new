  "description": "A mysterious creature of immense size appears in the galaxy, floating out of nowhere and slowly approaching Earth.\nSuddenly! A mouth opened, and the Earth was unexpectedly swallowed up in an instant, emitting an unknown light - BANG! The Seal explodes!\nFrom then on, a planet full of sea otters was born - the Arjaverse!\nThe planet is 75% water, ice, and gems, and its exterior retains the appearance of Earth and the unknown creature, becoming a fantastical illusion.\nThis gave rise to the incredibly cute and unique adventurers - the seal citizens from Arjaverse.",
